# Product Requirement Document (PRD) - ASBEL Programming Language

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for ASBEL (A Simple But Efficient Language), a new systems programming language designed to offer an unparalleled combination of developer productivity, code safety, and runtime performance. ASBEL aims to bridge the gap between high-level languages (like Python) that prioritize ease of use and low-level languages (like C++ and Rust) that prioritize control and efficiency.

## 2. Vision and Purpose

**Vision:** ASBEL will become the go-to language for building robust, high-performance systems software, empowering developers to write code that is as fast and efficient as C, as safe as Rust, and as readable as Python.

**Purpose:** To drastically reduce the cognitive load required for systems programming. ASBEL will achieve this by providing powerful, safe abstractions (like inferred ownership and refined types) over low-level details, while transpiling to C to leverage decades of compiler optimization and ensure transparent, "zero-cost" performance.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Systems Developers:** Engineers building operating systems, device drivers, embedded systems, and other low-level software who desire better safety and ergonomics than C.
*   **High-Performance Computing (HPC) Developers:** Programmers in gaming, scientific simulation, and quantitative finance who need maximum performance without the complexity of C++ or the steep learning curve of Rust.
*   **Backend & Cloud Developers:** Engineers building high-throughput network services, APIs, and databases where efficiency, concurrency, and safety are paramount.
*   **Developers from High-Level Languages (Python, JS, Go):** Programmers looking for a compiled language that offers superior performance and safety without sacrificing readability and a clean syntax.


## 4. Key Features & Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Language Core & Syntax
*   **Indentation-based Scoping:** Use significant whitespace for blocks, like Python, to enforce a clean, readable layout.
*   **Expression-Oriented:** Most constructs, including `if/else` and `match`, are expressions that return a value.
*   **Inferred Ownership & Borrowing:** The compiler will manage memory safety by inferring ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, eliminating the need for manual annotations (like Rust's `'a`) in the vast majority of cases.
*   **Named Arguments:** Function calls with more than two arguments must use named parameters to improve clarity and prevent errors.
*   **Pipeline Operators (`|>` and `=>`):** First-class support for composing functions in a highly readable, linear data flow.

### 4.2. Type System
*   **Strong, Static Typing:** With powerful type inference to minimize verbosity.
*   **Clear Mutability:** A clear distinction between immutable (`let`) and mutable (`var`) bindings.
*   **Refined Types:** The ability to constrain types with predicates (e.g., `age: u8(0..=120)`, `name: String(len > 0)`) that are checked at compile-time.
*   **Rich Composite Types:** Clean syntax for user-defined `type` (structs) and `enum`s.

### 4.3. Functions & Contracts
*   **Explicit Error Handling:** Functions that can fail must be marked (`!`) and return a `Result` type, with the `?` operator for ergonomic error propagation.
*   **Design by Contract:** First-class support for `requires` (preconditions) and `ensures` (postconditions) to build verifiable, robust software.

### 4.4. Abstraction & Polymorphism
*   **Interfaces (`interface`):** A trait-like system for defining shared behavior and enabling polymorphism.
*   **Implementations (`impl`):** A dedicated block for implementing methods on types and interfaces.
*   **Hygienic Macros:** A safe, powerful macro system for compile-time metaprogramming and reducing boilerplate.

### 4.5. Interoperability & Tooling
*   **Seamless C FFI:** A robust FFI for calling C code and for exporting ASBEL functions to be called by C.
*   **Integrated Toolchain (`asbel` CLI):** A single command for managing projects, dependencies, building, testing, formatting, and more.
*   **LSP for Modern Editors:** First-class support for a Language Server to provide an excellent IDE experience.

## 4. Key Features & Functional Requirements (Enhanced)

### 4.1. Language Core & Syntax
*   **Indentation-based Scoping**
*   **Expression-Oriented**
*   **Inferred Ownership & Borrowing**
*   **Named Arguments**
*   **Pipeline Operators (`|>` and `=>`)**
*   **Context-Aware Strings (e.g., `sql"..."`, `html"..."`)** for guaranteed-safe escaping.

### 4.2. Type System
*   **Strong, Static Typing** with powerful inference.
*   **Clear Mutability (`let`/`var`)**
*   **Refined Types** with compile-time checked predicates (e.g., ranges).
*   **Resource-Bound Types (`@auto_close`)** to extend ownership guarantees to system resources.
*   **Rich Composite Types (`type`, `enum`)**

### 4.3. Functions & Contracts
*   **Explicit Error Handling (`!`, `Result`, `?`)**
*   **Context-Aware Error Handling (`context` keyword)** for rich, traceable error chains.
*   **Design by Contract (`requires`/`ensures`)** for verifiable software.

### 4.4. Abstraction & Polymorphism
*   **Interfaces (`interface`)** for defining shared behavior.
*   **Implementations (`impl`)**
*   **Hygienic Macros and Compile-Time Derivations (`@derive`)** for powerful, safe metaprogramming.

### 4.5. Control Flow
*   **`if/else` as an expression**
*   **`guard` for early exit**
*   **`match` with exhaustive pattern matching, ranges, and `if let` guards.**

### 4.6. Concurrency and Parallelism
*   **Lightweight concurrent tasks (`spawn`)** with compile-time data race safety.
*   **Data parallelism hints (`@parallel`)** for automatic parallelization.

### 4.7. Integrated Tooling
*   **Integrated Testing Framework** with embedded unit and property-based tests.
*   **Integrated Debugging Hooks (`debug_snapshot`)** for advanced, time-travel debugging.
*   **Full `asbel` CLI Toolchain** (build, test, fmt, etc.).
*   **LSP for Modern Editors**

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Performance:** Compiled ASBEL code must be on par with or exceed the performance of equivalent, well-written C or Rust code. The transpilation to C is a key strategy here.
*   **Safety:** The language must guarantee memory safety and thread safety at compile-time for all safe code. `unsafe` code should be explicitly marked and minimized.
*   **Fast Compilation:** Build times should be competitive, aiming to be faster than Rust for comparable projects.
*   **Excellent Error Messages:** The compiler must produce clear, helpful, and actionable error messages that guide the developer to a solution.
*   **Portability:** Must compile and run on Linux, macOS, Windows, and support WebAssembly (WASM) as a primary compilation target.
*   **Documentation:** Comprehensive and accessible documentation for the language, standard library, and tools is a core deliverable.

## 6. Scope
**In-Scope (for v1.0):**
*   Complete language specification.
*   A self-hosted compiler/transpiler written in Rust that outputs C.
*   A core standard library.
*   The essential `asbel` CLI toolchain (`build`, `run`, `test`, `fmt`).
*   A functional LSP for VS Code.
*   Robust FFI support for C.

**Out-of-Scope (for v1.0):**
*   A garbage collector (ASBEL uses compile-time memory management).
*   A dedicated IDE.
*   Formal verification of all possible programs (though contracts are a step in this direction).
*   FFI support for languages other than C.

## 7. Success Metrics
