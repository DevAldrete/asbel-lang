    <p>ASBEL is designed with the future in mind. The following are experimental ideas being explored for future versions of the language, aiming to push the boundaries of systems programming and developer experience.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">Probabilistic Types</h3>
    <p>For the age of AI and data-driven applications, ASBEL is exploring types that can natively represent uncertainty and probability distributions.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-asbel">
// Conceptual: Likelihood of a value being within a certain confidence.
let confidence: f32~(0.8) = model.predict_score()
// The '~' might denote a probabilistic type, (0.8) being a parameter.

// Conceptual: A value that is 'true' with 95% probability.
let is_feature_active: Bool~(0.95) = check_remote_flag()
    </code></pre>
    <p>This could integrate statistical type checking and allow for more expressive modeling of real-world, uncertain data directly within the language.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">Time-Aware Types</h3>
    <p>For temporal programming, complex event processing, and systems where data history is critical, ASBEL is investigating time-aware types. These would allow variables to natively store and query their historical values or behavior over time.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-asbel">
// Conceptual: A variable that stores its value history for the last 5 minutes.
let stock_price: f64@history(5m) = get_live_stock_price("ASBL")

// Conceptual: Querying the average price over the last minute.
// let avg_price_last_minute = stock_price.history.average(1m)
    </code></pre>
    <p>This could simplify development of reactive systems, financial applications, and IoT data analysis tools.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-gray-800">Visual Pattern Matching</h3>
    <p>For multi-dimensional data like matrices, images, or structured text, ASBEL is exploring a visual, ASCII-art-like syntax for pattern matching. This could make matching on the structure of data more intuitive.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-asbel">
// Highly conceptual example for matching a 2x2 matrix pattern
match matrix_data
    visual_match
      | x, 0 |
      | 0, y | if x == y:
        println("Diagonal matrix with equal elements: \(x)" )
    _ :
        println("Other matrix form.")
    </code></pre>
    <p>These experimental features are subject to research and community feedback, aiming to keep ASBEL at the forefront of programming language innovation.</p>
